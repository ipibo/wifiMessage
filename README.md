## Requirements:

### Hardware
* ESP8266

(tested on a Wemos d1 mini pro, not tested on other ESP8266 modules)

* Android smartphone
* Powerbank

(I used [this](https://goo.gl/5Dv75q) powerbank, mainly because it was small)

* USB cable to power the ESP8266
* (Strong) Magnet

(I used [this](https://goo.gl/87LW1D) magnet, because it was the right size compared to my powerbank)

* Ducttape


### Software:

* Arduino IDE
* Processing IDE (with Android mode installed & enabled)

## Included in this git:

<!-- (Still have to change this names) -->

**String_to_hex_generator**

To generate the message to for the ESP8266

**wifiMessage_ESP8266**

The ESP8266 Sketch

**wifiMessage**

This is the app itself.

---

## How to install:

### Generate the prefixes

Open the *string_to_hex_generator* Processing sketch. 

In the Setup you will find ```String hexString = convertStringToHex("CHANGE THIS");```

Change the "CHANGE THIS" for your own secret message.

Run the Processing script. 

In the terminal below you will find the prefixes you have to use for the next step.

### On the ESP8266

Open *wifiMessage_ESP8266* with the Arduino environment

Use this instructions on [this](https://github.com/esp8266/Arduino#installing-with-boards-manager) Github to be install the ESP8266 board into the Arduino IDE.

After installation of the board go *tools -> boards* and select **Wemos D1 Mini Pro**

On top of the file change "\*ssids[10]" variable with the *SSIDS* generated by the Processing/python(?) sketch.

The format has to be like:

```
char *ssids[10] = {":/pF-0-56752048756e6", ":/pF-1-56e6365642074", ":/pF-2-7965617220696", ":/pF-3-f6e2e20687474", ":/pF-4-77772e66726f6", ":/pF-5-46566656e6465", ":/pF-6-2f656e2f63617", ":/pF-7-16e2d72696768", ":/pF-8-656e6465722d7", ":/pF-9-72d6172726573"};
 ```

Change the number inside of the "[]" to match the number of *SSIDS*. For this instance it is 10

Now upload the sketch to the *ESP 8266*.

---

### For the App

First enable *Android Mode* in Processing by clicking on the *JAVA* dropdown button in the upper right corner of the screen.

Open the "wifiMessage" Processing Sketch and make sure you have enabled *Android Mode*.

On your Android phone go to Settings -> About this Phone. And tap a couple of times on *Build number*. You now have enabled the so called *Developer options*.

Now go back to your setting, and here you see a new tab popped up called *Developer options*. Go to Developer options and enable "USB debugging".

Connect your phone to the computer and press on the upload button in the Processing IDE. This installs a new app on your phone called *wifiMessage*. 

This app does not work immidiately, you first have to give permissions to the app. To do this go to settings -> Apps -> wifiMessage. Here press the *Permissions* button, and allow it to use *Your location*.



<!--
1. Generate the SSIDS with the "test_wifif_ssids_with_prefix" Processing sketch.
2. Open wifiMessage_ESP8266 with the Arduino environment
